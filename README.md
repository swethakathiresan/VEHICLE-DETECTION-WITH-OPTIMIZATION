# VEHICLE-DETECTION-WITH-OPTIMIZATION

Image processing and computer vision play pivotal roles across various domains, enhancing image quality and extracting valuable insights. In the realm of traffic management, efficient handling of increasing vehicular traffic is imperative for safety and congestion mitigation. This paper explores diverse techniques and technologies for vehicle detection and counting in varied traffic scenarios. Leveraging Python's OpenCV library, state-of-the-art methodologies, including improved YOLO v5 networks and data enhancement algorithms, are implemented to achieve high accuracy in detection and counting, addressing challenges like occlusion and small target detection. Furthermore, the study introduces novel approaches, incorporating speed calculation, detection time analysis, vehicle type counting, and lane information, essential for effective traffic management. Experimental results, derived from real-time video captured by a single camera, underscore the system's potential for practical applications in highway management and traffic control. Additionally, the integration of traffic signal systems with detection data transmission enhances traffic flow optimization. Utilizing a combination of techniques, including YOLO, Random Forest with VGG16, and optimization methods such as Particle Swarm Intelligence, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Harmony Search Optimization, ensures robust performance and accuracy in traffic analysis and management.
